     * Returns a list of properties for a principal.

     * Every project is an array with the following keys:
     *  * id, a unique id that will be used by other functions to modify the
     *    calendar. This can be the same as the uri or a database key.
     *  * uri, which is the basename of the uri with which the calendar is
     *    accessed.
     *  * principaluri. The owner of the calendar. Almost always the same as
     *    principalUri passed to this method.
     *
     * Furthermore it can contain webdav properties in clark notation. A very
     * common one is '{DAV:}displayname'.
     *
     * Many clients also require:
     * {urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:caldav}supported-calendar-component-set
     * For this property, you can just return an instance of
     * Sabre\CalDAV\Property\SupportedCalendarComponentSet.

     * If you return {http://sabredav.org/ns}read-only and set the value to 1,
     * ACL will automatically be put in read-only mode.
